## Recommendation
-	**Offer discounts or loyalty points** for customers who commit to annual renewals to encourage long-term retention.
-	**Streamline the onboarding process** by simplifying steps and offering digital self-service options to improve the first customer experience.
-	**Ensure hassle-free installation** by minimizing delays and providing clear setup instructions or technician support.
-	**Introduce flexible pricing plans** for customers paying over $80/month to better match their needs and increase satisfaction.
-	**Promote automatic payments** to reduce late payments and improve billing consistency, which can help lower churn rates. This is especially important because customers using electronic checks show a higher tendency to churn compared to those using automated payment methods.
-	**Make billing user-friendly and transparent** to reduce confusion, disputes, and frustration.
-	**Enhance technical support services** by reducing wait times and improving resolution quality to boost customer confidence.
-	**Proactively address technical issues** that commonly lead to churn, such as service outages or connectivity problems.
